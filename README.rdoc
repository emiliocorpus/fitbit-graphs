== FITBITGRAPHS

[FitbitGraphs](http://www.fitbitgraphs.co/) is a Ruby on Rails application that utilizes the [FitbitAPI](https://dev.fitbit.com/) to gather and display certain Fitbit data. It was mainly constructed to better understand how to integrate APIs into a Ruby on Rails application with Oauth2. The application is currently read-only and only accesses (if authorized by the user) calories burend, steps taken, and badges earned. Other technologies used include Charts.js and JQuery.
